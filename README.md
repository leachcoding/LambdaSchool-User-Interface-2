# LambdaSchool-User-Interface-2

This is a repository for my Lambda School User Interface I section challenges and projects.

User Interface II

Basic HTML and CSS are fundamental to any web site or web app on the internet. Being able to create layouts using CSS is the next progression on your journey to a full stack web developer. In this module we will cover CSS resets, box model layout, display types, and positioning.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

-identify and use all properties in the box model

-use CSS display properties to build user interface

-implement a CSS reset and understand why itâ€™s important for cross browser development
